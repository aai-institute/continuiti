# Benchmarks

Run the `run_all.py` script to run all benchmarks.

```bash
python run_all.py
```

If you only want to evaluate a single benchmark, adopt the `run_single.py` script
and run

```bash
python run_single.py
```

## Visualize

In order to visualize the benchmark runs in your database, run

```bash
python process.py
```
