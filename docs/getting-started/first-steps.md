# First Steps

**continuiti** aims to implement recent advances in learning function operators,
i.e., mappings of (continuous) functions. If you are not familiar with the
concepts of operator learning, the page [[operators]] should introduce the
key concepts.

## Running the Examples

If you are familiar with the idea of operator learning (or just want to dive
right into code), you can start by browsing our examples illustrating
continuiti's capabilities, either:

- On the documentation page under <a href="../../examples">Examples</a>.
- Locally, by starting a jupyter server and navigating to the `examples` directory.
