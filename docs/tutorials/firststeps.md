**continuiti** aims to implement recent advances of operator learning.
It provides cutting-edge deep learning approaches to learn mappings of
(continuous) functions.

Operator learning is motivated by the fact that many problems in science and
engineering are formulated in terms of functions.
While conventional neural networks learn between vector-spaces, neural operators
learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces.

In the following, we will kindly introduce you step-by-step to the concepts of
operator learning. We start with installing **continuiti** and then move on
to the basics of operator learning with simple examples.


## Installing continuiti

Install the latest version of **continuiti** using pip:
```
pip install continuiti
```

**continuiti** requires Python>=3.9 and is built on top of
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
